  <h1 class="callout-title">About Geoscan</h1>
  <div class="callout-copy">
    <p>
      Geoscan Pte. Ltd. (formerly known as Geoscan Instruments Pte. Ltd.) 
      was incorporated in Singapore in March of 1989 to meet the demand for 
      geotechnical instrumentation and soil investigation services.
    </p>
     
    <p>
      In the early years of her incorporation, the company was mostly involved 
      in soil investigation works, such as the SBC TV World in Tuas, developments 
      in southern islands (Pulau Seraya, Pulau Ayer Merbau, Pulau Serabok), Changi 
      Ferry Terminal, Ngee Ann City and many infrastructure and building projects. 
      As the demand for geotechnical works increased in 1990s, Geoscan focus its core 
      business to include more instrumentation scope. Hence, we gave our clients a 
      convenient and cost efficient solution to their instrumentation needs. The 
      company has continued to grow by introducing more services, including <em>Real 
      Time Monitoring for Vibration, Micro-Vibration, Noise and EL-tilt meter</em>. In 
      order to better enhance value to our customers, Geoscan has also been involved
      in further studies with the Singapore scientific community to study how to better 
      measure ground vibrations.  Another way in which the company enhances customer’s 
      value is through the regular renewal and upgrading of our assets.
    </p>

    <h3>Corporate Mission</h3>
    <p> 
    We strive to provide the most cost efficient and reliable services and solutions for 
    our Clients in the field of geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring and soil investigation services.

    <p>Call me <em>Ishmael</em>. Some years ago–<em>never mind how long
precisely</em>–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off
the spleen and regulating the circulation.</p>

  <h2>THE FOUNDERS</h2>
  <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
    Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
    sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a
    billion people, and probably more.

          Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
          Michael is the creator of the
          <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
          Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
          <a href="https://learnenough.com/">
          Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michael is also notorious as the founder of
          <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and
          author of <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau
          Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are
          slightly exaggerated.

          When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes

          interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

          You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on
          Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true
          nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code
          from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
